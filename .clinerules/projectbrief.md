# Project Brief: PL Analyzer Upgrade

This project focuses on upgrading the `PL-temperature_and_power_Analyzer`, a Python-based desktop application for analyzing photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy data. The goal is to enhance its data parsing capabilities and introduce new plotting features to improve flexibility and user experience for scientific data analysis.

## Core Objectives:
1.  **Enhance Filename Parsing**: Improve the robustness of the metadata extraction from filenames to support more varied naming conventions.
2.  **Add Advanced Plotting**: Introduce a new feature to plot stacked, normalized spectra with a user-configurable offset.
