### Task 3: Build .exe Distribution

**Prerequisites:**
- PyInstaller is installed in venv_build
- `run_app.spec` file exists and is configured

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Activate build environment
.\venv_build\Scripts\activate

# Build the executable
pyinstaller run_app.spec

# The .exe will be in dist/ folder
```

**Verify Build:**
- Check `dist/run_app.exe` or `dist/PL_analyzer.exe` exists
- Test the .exe runs without errors
- Test at least one major feature (e.g., load files, plot data)

**Distribution Package:**
Include in distribution:
- The .exe file
- `config.json` (template)
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE` (if exists)

---

### Task 4: Git Commit & Push to GitHub

**Steps:**

1. **Review Changes:**
```bash
git status
```

2. **Stage All Changes:**
```bash
git add .
```

3. **Commit with Meaningful Message:**
```bash
git commit -m "Complete Phase 3: B-Field UI Enhancements & Final Deployment

- All Phase 3 tasks complete (Tasks 0-6)
- Added normalized stacked B-field plots with selection
- Added dedicated B-field intensity map window with RGB improvements
- Added variable integration times and sweep direction support
- Enhanced temperature analysis with dual-plot layout
- Added auto-reset polarization feature
- Updated all documentation
- Cleaned up temporary files
- Ready for production release"
```

4. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

5. **Optional - Create Release Tag:**
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0-phase3 -m "Phase 3 Complete - Full Feature Release"
git push origin v1.0.0-phase3
```

### Task 5: Final Verification

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Documentation shows 100% completion
- [ ] Temporary files removed
- [ ] `.exe` builds successfully
- [ ] `.exe` runs and opens the GUI
- [ ] Can load data files in `.exe` version
- [ ] All changes committed to Git
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub repository shows latest commit
- [ ] No sensitive data in repository

## Important File Paths

**Specs for Building:**
- `run_app.spec` - Main spec file for PyInstaller
- `main.spec` - Alternative spec file (if needed)

**Virtual Environments:**
- `venv/` - Development environment
- `venv_build/` - Build environment (use this for PyInstaller)

**Output:**
- `dist/` - Generated executable location
- `build/` - Build artifacts (can be deleted after successful build)

**Git:**
- `.gitignore` - Ensures build artifacts and venv aren't committed
- `.git/` - Git repository

---

## GitHub Repository Information

**Repository URL:** (Check with `git remote -v`)

**Branch:** main (or master)

**What to Push:**
- All source code in `pl_analyzer/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Configuration files (`config.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Spec files for building
- README, LICENSE
- Test data in `test_data/` (if not too large)

**What NOT to Push:**
- `venv/`, `venv_build/` (ignored by .gitignore)
- `build/`, `dist/` folders (ignored by .gitignore)
- `__pycache__/` folders (ignored by .gitignore)
- `.pyc` files (ignored by .gitignore)

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… All documentation reflects 100% completion  
âœ… Temporary files cleaned up  
âœ… `.exe` builds successfully and runs  
âœ… All changes committed to Git  
âœ… Changes pushed to GitHub  
âœ… Repository is clean and well-documented  
âœ… Ready for production use  

---

## Notes for Agent

- **Be careful with git operations** - review changes before committing
- **Test the .exe** before declaring success
- **Don't force push** unless absolutely necessary
- **Keep backups** of important files before deleting
- If PyInstaller fails, check for missing dependencies in spec file
- If git push fails, may need to pull first: `git pull origin main`

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build .exe
.\venv_build\Scripts\activate
pyinstaller run_app.spec

# Test .exe
.\dist\run_app.exe

# Git operations
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your message here"
git push origin main

# Check remote
git remote -v
```

This is the final deployment! The application is complete and ready for production use. ðŸŽ‰
