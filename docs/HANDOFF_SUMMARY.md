# Implementation Handoff Summary

Last Updated: October 25, 2025
Status: Phase 3 Complete — All Tasks Done (100%)

What's Done (Phase 3)
- Task 0: Integrate vs B-field window reopen bug fixed (destroy/recreate, robust TclError handling)
- Task 1: Normalized Stacked (B-Field)
  - Dual-polarization overlay at same offset with transparency
  - Selectable B-field values in a popup, custom step interval (free text, e.g., 0.75 T)
  - Repositioned toggle near Plot B-Field Series; summary label of selection
- Tasks 2–3: B-Field Intensity Map Window + RGB improvements
  - New window `bfield_intensity_map_window.py` with energy/intensity ranges, log color, log B-axis, map modes
  - Separate σ+ (red) / σ− (blue) colorbars (independent show/hide), info box with ranges and position control (inside/outside)
  - Export options with format (PNG/PDF/SVG/JPEG), DPI and transparency; publication-friendly layout
  - Canvas sizing/layout improved (axes labels visible), and multi‑colorbar layout handled
  - Optional normalization per spectrum for RGB mode; UI toggle provided

Code Touchpoints
- New: pl_analyzer/gui/windows/bfield_intensity_map_window.py
- Updated: plot_canvas (RGB map + multi‑colorbar + info overlay), right_panel (button), bfield_analysis_actions (open action)
- Selection popup fixes (apply/select/invert) in bfield_selection_window

Small Follow‑up (Nice‑to‑Have)
- Color base control for RGB maps: add a user control that shifts the lower end of each channel from white to a user‑selectable light tone (e.g., light red/blue) with an adjustable lightness/threshold. This makes low‑intensity regions less washed out. (Note only — no implementation required for the next step unless requested.)

All Tasks Complete
✅ Task 4: Variable integration time ranges - COMPLETE
   - UI rows with B-field min/max and time (s) implemented
   - Persisted in config; used in parser when loading sweep files
✅ Task 5: Temperature analysis dual-plot window - COMPLETE
   - Side-by-side Arrhenius + linear plots with style controls
   - Integration range and export functionality added
✅ Task 6: Auto-reset polarization - COMPLETE
   - Polarization resets automatically when magnetic checkbox is unchecked
✅ Task 9: Documentation/testing polish - COMPLETE
   - All documentation updated and polished

Notes
- Use existing patterns for dialogs and config helpers
- Keep plots publication‑ready; follow existing style options
- Avoid regressions in power/temp series and the polarized sum workflow
